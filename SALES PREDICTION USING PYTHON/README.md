# SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Welcome to the Sales Prediction Using Python project submission for the Data Science Internship at CodSoft! This project aims to use Python and machine learning techniques.

## Overview :
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audienc segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let's embark on the journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python.

## About Dataset :
### Description:
The advertising dataset captures the sales revenue generated with respect to advertisement costs across multiple channels like radio, tv, and newspapers. It is required to understand the impact of ad budgets on the overall sales.

## Dataset used from kaggle :
https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input

## Algorithms Used :
  - Logistic Regression

## Main Outcomes :
1. Total money spent on each type of advertisement
    - Tv is highest among all.
    - Newspaper is 2nd highest.
    - Radio is Least in all.

2. TV advertisements has highest impact on the sales with correlation 0.9

3. Model Accuracy:
  -  The model explains 91.4% of the variability in the training data and 87.3% in the test data.
  -  MAE and MSE values indicate good prediction accuracy with slightly higher errors on the test data.

4. Impact of Advertising Channels:
  -  TV Advertising: Highest impact on sales, making it the most effective channel.
  - Radio Advertising: Provides stable returns with less risk.
  - Newspaper Advertising: Lower impact on sales, suggesting less effectiveness compared to TV and radio.

5. Recommendations:
  - Increase investment in TV advertising for maximum impact.
  - Maintain stable investment in radio advertising for consistent returns.
  - Reevaluate newspaper advertising strategy and consider reallocating budget to more effective channels.

## Conclusion :

### The analysis demonstrates that advertising spending positively correlates with sales, with TV advertising having the highest impact. By strategically increasing investments in the most effective channels, the company can optimize its advertising budget to maximize sales and achieve better returns on investment.
