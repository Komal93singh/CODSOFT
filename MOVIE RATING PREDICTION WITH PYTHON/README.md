# Movie Rating Prediction with Python
Welcome to the Movie Rating Prediction project submission for the Data Science Internship at CodSoft! This project aims to predict movie ratings using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Overview
In this project, we leverage Python programming and machine learning algorithms to predict movie ratings based on various features such as duration, genre, director, and actors. The project explores the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains machine learning models, and evaluates their performance for rating prediction.

The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

This project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately

## About Dataset :
Task Details
Every dataset has a story and this set is pulled from IMDb.com of all the Indian movies on the platform. Clean this data by removing missing values or adding average values this process will help to manipulate the data to help with your EDA.

### Dataset contains :
- Name
- Year
- Duration
- Genre
- Rating
- Votes
- Director
- Actor 1
- Actor 2
- Actor 3

## Dataset used from kaggle :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies/data

## Algorithms Used :
- Logistic Regression

## Conclusion :
- Top 10 Highest rated movies :
    - Actor 'Mithun Chakraborty' has done movies with highest rate.
    - Actor 'Amitabh Bachchan' has done movies with 2nd highest rate.
    - Actor 'Rekha' and 'Ajay Devgn' have done movies with least rate.

- Top 25 Directors of frequent of movies :
    - Director 'David Dhawan' amongst  to do the highest frequent of movies.
    - Director 'Gulzar' , 'Raj N.Sippy' , 'Satyen Bose' and 'Babubhai Mistry' have least in top 25.

  
- In this project, I explored the task of predicting movie ratings using a linear regression model. My analysis revealed valuable insights into the performance and effectiveness of the model in capturing the variability in movie ratings.

- The evaluation of the linear regression model yielded promising results. The model demonstrated a relatively low Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.3529 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.4431, indicating that, on average, the model's predictions were close to the actual ratings. Additionally, the R-squared (R2) score of 0.7964 indicated that approximately 79.64% of the variance in the movie ratings was explained by the model.

- These findings suggest that the linear regression model shows potential for accurately predicting movie ratings. However, it's important to acknowledge that there may be additional factors and complexities influencing movie ratings that were not captured in our analysis. Further research and refinement of the model, possibly incorporating additional features or employing more advanced modeling techniques, could lead to even more accurate predictions.
