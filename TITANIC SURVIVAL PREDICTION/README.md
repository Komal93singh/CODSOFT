# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project submission for the Data Science Internship at CodSoft! This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. The project involves implementing machine learning algorithms to Survival prediction using Python.

## Overview :
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew. In this project, we aim to analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, to predict which passengers survived the disaster.

## About Dataset :
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
The dataset typically used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which is widely used for machine learning and data analysis purposes. It contains various features such as passenger class, age, sex, fare, and whether the passenger survived or not.

## Dataset used from kaggle :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset

## Project Structure :
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Machine Learning Model Building
   
## Algorithms Used :
There are 6 Algorithms are used :
1. Logistic Regression 
2. Decision Tree 
3. Random Forest 
4. SVC 
5. KNN 
6. SVC

## Major Outcomes :
1. Status of Suvival people :
    - Only 38.38% people are Survived.
    - 61.62% people are not Survived.
    
2. Status of 'male' passenger :
    - Only 18.89% male are Survived.
    - 81.11% people who are male are not survived.        

3. Status of 'Female' passenger :
    - Only 74.20% female are survived.
    - 25.80% female are not survived
      
### Here, Status of Survival rate was higher in female comparison to male

## Conclusion :
In this project, I explored the task of Titanic Survival Prediction. My analysis revealed valuable insights into the performance and effectiveness of the model in capturing the survival prediction.

In this project, I compared six machine learning algorithms for Titanic Survival prediction with their accuracy :
1. Logistic Regression : Accuracy 77.65%
2. Decision Tree : Accurcay 77.09%
3. Random Forest : Accuracy 79.32%
4. SVC : Accuracy 62.01%
5. KNN : Accuracy 67.03%
6. SVC : Accuracy 62.01%
   
Random Forest slightly outperformed the Logistic Regression , Decision Tree Classifier,Gaussian NB, KNN & SVC, indicating it was better suited for this dataset. However, All models demonstrated strong performance, confirming the effectiveness of these techniques for Titanic survival prediction . Future work could explore other advanced algorithms to further improve accuracy.

### These findings suggest that Random Forest model with Accuracy (79.32%) shows potential for accurately predicting survival. However, it's important to acknowledge that there may be additional factors and complexities influencing prediction that were not captured in our analysis. Further research and refinement of the model, possibly incorporating additional features or employing more advanced modeling techniques, could lead to even more accurate predictions.
